### Main codes

1. The procedure for defining individualized cortical parcellations at the 400-region level closely follows the MSHBM manual (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/e629fa17180f1e02cb507e1d852ea7a1aaf23544/stable\_projects/brain\_parcellation/Kong2022\_ArealMSHBM);
2. Codes in the "Split\_match" folder are used to split the African Americans(AA) into 5 folds and match white Americans (WA) with AA within each fold on the basis of age, sex and root-mean-square framewise displacement (RMS);
3. Codes in the "KRR\_group\_prediction" folder are used to perform resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) -based ethnicity/race group prediction;
4. Codes in the "Morphometric\_similarity\_analysis" folder are used to evaluate ethnicity/race-related variations in cortical morphometry;
5. Codes in the "KRR\_lifestyle\_prediction" folder are used to construct RSFC-based lifestyle factor prediction models;
6. Codes in the "SEM" folder are used to conduct structural equation models for figure 4 in the manuscript;
7. Codes in the "Interaction\_effect\_analysis" folder are used to perform interaction effects modelling for figure 4 in the manuscript;
8. Codes in the "Transcriptomic\_analysis" folder utilizes data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) to conduct transcriptomeâ€“neuroimaging association analyses.
